  <h1> What If You Poured Some Water On The Sun?</h1>

  <p>The solar system is vast and full of mystery, and even the people who have explored it don’t know exactly what’s out there. But the sun has never been disputed. Nevertheless, the center of our universe won’t always be there. The timeline for its demise is a long way off, but could anything be done to make it happen sooner? Could pouring a glass of water on the sun extinguish it?</p>

 <p>The sun is a star, and it’s the center of our universe. It’s composed of 74.9% hydrogen and 23.8% helium, with the remaining 1.3% belonging to the heavier metals of oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron. Right now, the sun is about halfway through the main sequence of its evolution. Astronomers think that the sun gets about 1% brighter every 100 million years.
- As the sun burns brighter and gets bigger, it will eventually turn into a red giant. The sun has enough mass and currently produces enough energy to burn for a total of 10 billion years. But after 6 billion years, hydrogen fuel will run out.
- On Earth, combustion needs fuel, air, and heat to occur. We use water to put fires out because they can’t burn through the coating of water over their fuel. But there’s no air in space, and water can’t stop the thermonuclear reactions that cause the sun to burn. So really we’ve just gathered all that water and brought it to the sun only for it to be burned as well. Our huge glass of water would actually make the sun get hotter and burn 6 times brighter.
- Pouring our gigantic glass of water onto the sun won’t extinguish it, but it will actually create a whole new sun! How cool is that? This new sun, with an even greater mass than our current one, will produce exponentially more energy for us to live off.
- If we don’t bring that huge glass of water into outer space and pour it onto the sun, then it will continue its thermonuclear fusion and stay on its projected path of destruction as planned.
